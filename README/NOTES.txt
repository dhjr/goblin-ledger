Gems earned from clan games are not included in this calculation. If you regularly complete clan games each month and choose gems as rewards, you'll need significantly less time."

Higher the required gems,more accurate is the prediction.

Time requirement for obstacle is based on the following assumptions
1. A new obstacle is produced every 8 hours to a total of 3 per day per base
2. each obstacle provides an average of 2gems.

In reality The gems from each obstacle follow a repeating sequence: 6, 0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0. On average, each cleared obstacle yields 2 gems.
